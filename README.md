***DeepFake Source Code using OpenCV and Mediapipe***

This code illustrates a basic face swapping method that uses OpenCV for image processing and a Mediapipe library for facial landmark identification. The video is taken using the default camera by the application, which then analyzes the source image
for facial landmarks and overlayes the user's face over those landmarks in the destination vidfeo feed.

**Requirements**
- Python ("py")
- OpenCV ("cv2")
- Numpy ("numpy")
- Mediapipe ("mediapipe")

***How to Use***
1. Run the script
   ```bash
   py trytrytry.py
   ```
2. The program captures the application camera
3. The source imaga "hehe.jpg" is loaded. Also, the facial landmarks. (feel free to input any picture, just rename the file)
4. The program swaps the face from the source image to the detected facial landmark
5. Press "q" to exit the application.
